# tic-tac-toe

Tic Tac Toe Game implemented in Clojure.

You need to have Clojure and Leiningen installed on your machine.

The tests use speclj for assertions and verifications. This dependency will be pulled down when you run the unit tests for the first time. Alternatively you can tell leiningen to pull them down explicitly using the command `lein deps`.

To run the application clone the project into a folder

>> git clone git@github.com:gemcfadyen/Apprenticeship-ClojureTicTacToe.git

To run the tests, do
>> lein spec -a

To play the game, do
>> lein run
